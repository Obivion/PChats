Triggered chat tool for Windower, Written in LUA

This addon is designed to enhance the Final Fantasy XI experience by adding a bit of personality and flair to general gameplay. It can inject a dose of humor and entertainment into your party chat by automatically sending customized messages when you use certain abilities or spells. Or simply be used to call out those critical abilities or spells as they are being used.

Support for theme packs or rule packs is fully supported, being able to be tailored for a personal configuration. A Futurama theme was developed to test functionality and is a good starting point to develop more constomised packs.

The addon also offers a "fun mode" that allows you to unleash a barrage of your quirky and amusing messages, adding a lighthearted touch to your adventures. And if you want to make sure your messages always get through, you can activate the "force mode" to guarantee 100% delivery. Messages are defined as Critical or Fun, Fun messages are disabled by default to prevent spam.
